# How The dWeb Works
The dWeb is a very intricate and powerful system. When combined with other technologies like Blockchain, it's mind-blowing the ideas one can bring to life. While the [ARISEN](https://arisen.network) blockchain does bring to life tools that can be used by developers to extend the capabilities of their applications, like dDNS, User Authentication and Smart Contracts - they operate outside of the dWeb's protocol suite. I want to utilize this section to explain exactly how the dWeb works at the protocol level. In other words, how two or more peers exchange data with each other.

This section is made up of the following topics:
- [dDatabases and dDrives](ddatabases-and-ddrives.md)
- [dWeb's DHT](dweb-dht.md)
- [Peer Discovery](peer-discovery.md)
- [The Sky Is The Limit](the-sky-is-the-limit.md)

## Where Blockchains Come Into Play
As I mentioned above, ARISEN brings to life many tools that can be used by developers to extend the functionality of their applications. Follow the links below to learn more about these tools.

- [Arisen's Official Documentation](https://docs.arisen.network)
- [User Authentication](../user-authentication/index.md)
- [Global Computer](../global-computer/index.md)
- [Arisen's Official Website](https://arisen.network)

To add to that, any blockchain can be used. Web developers are not forced to integrate with ARISEN. It's simply our blockchain of choice.
