There are many ins and outs to dWeb's decentralized Domain Name System (dDNS). We have created a set of modules for interacting with the `dDNS Root System`, `NameDrives`, querying distributed domain databases and more. You will learn how to do all of that and more in this section.

The dDNS modules and other tools covered in this section include:
- [NameDrive](namedrive.md)
- [Lookup](lookup.md)
- [Query](query.md)
- [Network](network.md)
- [Root System Smart Contract](root-system-smart-contract.md)
